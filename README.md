<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Forked from: https://github.com/Ishaan35/Unity3D-Mario-Kart-Racing-Game thanks for the foundations

Keeping it open source.

Inspired by Mario Kart 8

Yes the logo is a temp ai generated image, I can barely draw a stickman lol

## Setup
This project has been upgraded to use Unity 6.
More specifically version 6000.3.9f1

IMPORTANT
.blend files MUST be associated with blender. If you do not have blender it is free to download off Steam. That's at least what I did.

Once thats ready open the project after adding it to your Unity Hub and let it import.

## My changes
 * Updated the project to Unity 6 from 2021.
   > I had to remove Beautify, I do not own Beautify 3
 * Updated the input system to use Unity's new input system
 * Added controller support
   - Accelerate (Cross (PS5), A (Xbox), B (Nintendo))
   - Reverse (Circle (PS5), B (Xbox), A (Nintendo))
   - Look Behind (Triangle (PS5), Y (Xbox), X (Nintendo))
   - Use Item (L1 (PS5), LB (Xbox), L (Nintendo))
   - Drift, Trick etc (R2 (PS5), RT (Xbox), ZR (Nintendo))
   - Steer / Glide (Left analog stick (ALL))
   - Throw Item Back (Right stick down (ALL))
 * Updated Keyboard controls
   - Accelerate (W, Up Arrow)
   - Reverse (S, Down Arrow)
   - Look Behind (B)
   - Use Item (E)
   - Drift, Trick etc (Left Shift)
   - Steer (A, Left Arrow, D, Right Arrow)
   - Glider (W, Up Arrow, S, Down Arrow)
   - Throw Item Back (Left Ctrl)
 * Modding functionality
   - UGC Maps
   > Clone the repo, Create your map, add the scene to an asset bundle like "course_testmap" and then at the top "Mod Tools" -> Build All

## My plans
 * Refactor the code base because holy moly my eyeballs
 * Proper main menu
 * Custom characters
 * Custom maps
 * Custom items
   > Asset Bundles not including scripts might make this a pain
 * Map pack system (grand prix's, styled similar to DD)
 * Loading custom content via asset bundles during runtime (characters, maps, items etc)
   > Testing with Mario Kart 8 mod https://models.spriters-resource.com/wii_u/mariokart8/
 * Real AI
 * Multiplayer via Mirror & Epic Online Services
 * Character selection (characters will PURELY be cosmetic)
 * MK8 style kart building
 * Double Item box?
 * Integrate Mod.io for User Generate Content / Content distribution (Keys and wotnot will not be included in the repo, but they will be in Release builds)
 * Integrate Moon Sharp for lua scripting

> I'm trying to make something close to MK8D but not MK8 so any public release will have mario content stripped out, so no suing me Nintendo. But it will be incredibly moddable too
